The Durable Execution section of the Temporal Developer's guide covers advanced beginner concepts for working with Temporal, including testing your code, reviewing workflow event history, adding timers, and understanding determinism. Developing for durable execution is a core aspect of Temporal, and builds on the concepts introduced in our [Foundations](https://docs.temporal.io/dev-guide/go/foundations) guide.

For more information about Durable Execution, refer to our [blog about Building Reliable Distributed Systems in Node.js](https://temporal.io/blog/building-reliable-distributed-systems-in-node) and our [Temporal 102 course](https://learn.temporal.io/courses/temporal_102/).
