Referred to as "intrinsic non-determinism" this kind of "bad" Workflow code can prevent the Workflow code from completing because the Workflow can take a different code path than the one expected from the Event History.

The following are some common operations that **can't** be done inside of a Wokflow Definition:

- Generate and rely on random numbers (Use Activites instead).
- Accessing / mutating external systems or state.
  This includes calling an external API, conducting a file I/O operation, talking to another service, etc. (use Activities instead).
- Relying on system time.
  - Use `workflow.Now()` as a replacement for `time.Now()`.
  - Use `workflow.Sleep()` as a replacement for `time.Sleep()`.
- Working directly with threads or goroutines.
  - Use `workflow.Go()` as a replacement for the `go` statement.
  - Use `workflow.Channel()` as a replacement for the native `chan` type.
    Temporal provides support for both buffered and unbuffered channels.
  - Use `workflow.Selector()` as a replacement for the `select` statement.
- Iterating over data structures with unknown ordering.
  This includes iterating over maps using `range`, because with `range` the order of the map's iteration is randomized.
  Instead you can collect the keys of the map, sort them, and then iterate over the sorted keys to access the map.
  This technique provides deterministic results.
  You can also use a Side Effect or an Activity to process the map instead.
- Storing or evaluating the run Id.

One way to produce a non-deterministic error is to sleep for a random amount of time inside the Workflow.

	}
	ctx = workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, activityOptions)
	var ssnTraceResult string

	// CAUTION, the following code is an anti-pattern showing what NOT to do
	time.Sleep(time.Duration(rand.Intn(10)) * time.Second)
