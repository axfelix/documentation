TestReplayWorkflowHistoryFromFile tests the code against the existing Worklow History saved to the JSON file.
This Replay test is the recommended way to make sure changing workflow code is backward compatible without non-deterministic errors.
"your_workflow_history.json" can be downloaded from the Web UI or the Temporal CLI:

    `temporal workflow show --workflow-id your-workflow-id --output json  > your_workflow_history.json`

The following code sample comes from a working and tested sample application.
The code sample might be abridged within the guide to highlight key aspects.

```go
func TestReplayWorkflowHistoryFromFile(t *testing.T) {
	replayer := worker.NewWorkflowReplayer()

	replayer.RegisterWorkflow(YourWorkflowDefinition)

	err := replayer.ReplayWorkflowHistoryFromJSONFile(nil, "your_workflow_history.json")
	require.NoError(t, err)
}
```
