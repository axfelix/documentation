Welcome to Temporal Python SDK developer's guide!

The open source Temporal Python SDK alpha version first released on March 18, 2022, and has been enabling Python developers to build Temporal Applications ever since.

The Python SDK and its contributors have crafted a developer experience that aims to combine and provide both the benefits of the Temporal programming model and idiomatic Python programming paradigms.

## What Python programming skills and experiences are useful when using the Python SDK?

You can start working with the SDK with only Python knowledge.
Temporal abstracts a lot of the complexity of distributed systems, but to unlock its full potential, having a broad base of knowledge will help you design more efficient and resilient systems.

We recommend that developers possess at least a moderate level of experience in practicing the following skills to develop production-level Temporal Applications:

### Basic Knowledge

- Python syntax and structure
- Data types
  - Strings
  - Integers
  - Lists
  - Dictionaries
- Control Statements
  - Loops
  - Conditionals
- Functions
- Decorators
- [Data Classes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html)

### Development Environment

- IDE like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com) for version control
- [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) or [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for package management

### Object-Oriented Programming

- Classes and objects
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation

For very complex and large-scale use cases, having at least some experience with a variation of the following could be helpful:

### Advanced Language Features

- [Asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) and custom `asyncio` event loop
- Exception handling
- List comprehensions
- Type safety (with [type hints](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/) or [annotations](https://peps.python.org/pep-3107/))
- Threads and concurrency

### Asynchronous Programming

- [Shielding from cancellation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#shielding-from-cancellation)
- Different Activity Types
    - [Run in executor](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.loop.run_in_executor)
    - [ThreadPoolExecutor](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#threadpoolexecutor)
    - [ProcessPoolExecutor](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#processpoolexecutor)

### Testing and Debugging

- [Pytest](https://pytest.org) or other testing frameworks
- Temporal test server
- Basic profiling and debugging
- [MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) or other type checkers

### Design Patterns

- Dependency injections
- Sagas

### Databases

- Familiarity with SQL or NoSQL databases
- Database connection and queries in Python

### Software Architecture & Design

- Software system design and architecture
- Distributed systems and scalability
    - Event-driven architectures
    - Stateful vs stateless processes
    - Scalability implications
    - Fault tolerance

### Security

- Handling PII and sensitive information
- Encryption and secure coding practices

## Where is the Temporal Python SDK API reference?
